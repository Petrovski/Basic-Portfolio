            <p> Hello everyone! My name is Alex, welcome to my portfolio home page. 
                I was born and raised by 1st generation immigrant parents in south east Michigan. 
                I first got into web development in early 2018, where I used a course on uDemy by Colt Steele to gain a basic knowledge in a lot of areas pertaining to development.
                I really enjoyed it and thought of it not as studying or work, but more like leisure time.
                Because of this feeling I got while coding, I had really wanted to turn this into something more.
                I wanted to make it into something I could do for a living, freelancing or working for a company.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Having some experience with a previous online course in web devleopment,
                I knew that taking this bootcamp would solidify my chances for getting this going for real.
                It's important to find something you love doing, and making a living in life. That is the real end goal in my opinion, to
                be happy and healthy for a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another few things I like doing are analyzing financial markets, going for a bike ride, and playing with my dogs.
