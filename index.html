            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Alex, welcome to my portfolio home page. 
                I was born and raised by 1st generation immigrant parents in south east Michigan. 
                I first got into web development in early 2018, where I used a course on uDemy by Colt Steele to gain a basic knowledge in a lot of areas pertaining to development.
                I really enjoyed it and thought of it not as studying or work, but more like leisure time.
            </p>
